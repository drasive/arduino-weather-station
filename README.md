## Configuration
The configuration values are found at the top of [arduino-weather-station.ino](/arduino-weather-station/arduino-weather-station.ino).  
A value in angled brackets ([]) indicates an external constant, a slash (-) indicates no value.

## Documentation
### Status LED
The following states are communicated using the onboard LED:
- Initializing: LED is off (after turning the device on)
- Initialized:  LED blinks three times (after initializing)
- Active:       LED is on (reading or logging sensor values)
- Idle:         LED is off (waiting for next update)
- Failing:      LED blinks (last update failed)

### Serial Bus
All actions are communicated through the serial interface. This can be used for wired operation or debugging.

### Data Logging (Ubidots)
If turned on (`LOG_DATA`), the temperature and humidity readings will be send to your [Ubidots](https://ubidots.com/) account.  
This requires an active network connection (`WLAN_SSID` and `WLAN_PASSWORD`), a Ubidots token (`UBIDOTS_TOKEN`) and the data source IDs (`UBIDOTS_ID_TEMPERATURE` and `UBIDOTS_ID_HUMIDITY`) to be configured.

### Data Logging (ThingSpeak)
Logging data to ThingSpeak was removed in commit #147cc09 because it was not reliable.

### Failing to read/ log data
If reading any sensor, connecting to the network or logging data fails, it is retried for up to a total of three times.

### Photoresistor
If you don't want to use a photoresistor, revert the changes of commit #a100466 or remove the corresponding code.

## Libraries
- SPI v1.0.0 by Arduino
- WiFi101 v0.12.0 by Arduino
- [DHT v1.3.0 by Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library) (external)
- [UbidotsArduino #2803d20 by Ubidots](https://github.com/ubidots/ubidots-arduino-wifi) (external)

## Feature Ideas
1. Support LCD panel: Planned by the end of January 2016
1. Support barometer: Planned by the end of February 2016
1. Exclude sensitive data from repository: Not worth the effort
1. Keep hisotry of most recent sensor readings: Not worth the effort as long as network connecting works reliably
1. Use better library for uploading to Ubidots: Not worth the effort as long as UbidotsArduino works reliably
1. Add command/ button to force update: Not worth the complexity and effort
